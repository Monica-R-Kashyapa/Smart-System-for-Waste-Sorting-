        <p>Waste refers to any material that is discarded because it no longer serves a useful purpose. It comes in various forms, including solid, 
           liquid, or gas, and can be generated from households, industries, agriculture, and even natural processes. Proper waste management is 
           essential for maintaining a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.</p>

        <p>There are several types of waste, each requiring different methods of disposal and recycling:</p>

                <div class="category">
                    <h4>Recyclable waste</h4>
                    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/recyclable.png') }}" alt="Recyclable">
                    <p>This includes materials that can be reprocessed and reused, such as paper, plastics, glass, and metals. Recycling helps conserve 
                        natural resources, reduces energy consumption, and minimizes pollution.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="category">
                    <h4>Compostable waste</h4>
                    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/compostable.png') }}" alt="Compostable">
                    <p>Organic waste such as food scraps, yard trimmings, and paper products can decompose naturally and be used to enrich soil. Composting 
                        is an eco-friendly way to reduce landfill waste and promote soil health.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="category">
                    <h4>Non-Recyclable waste</h4>
                    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/non-recyclable.png') }}" alt="Non-Recyclable">
                    <p>Items that cannot be recycled due to their composition or contamination, like certain types of plastic, diapers, and certain electronic 
                        waste, fall into this category. Proper disposal of non-recyclable waste is crucial to prevent environmental harm.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="category">
                    <h4>Dry waste</h4>
                    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/dry.png') }}" alt="Dry">
                    <p>This includes materials that do not contain moisture, such as plastic, metal, and glass. Dry waste is typically easier to handle and can 
                        often be recycled.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="category">
                    <h4>Wet waste</h4>
                    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/wet.png') }}" alt="Wet">
                    <p>Wet waste includes organic waste, such as food scraps, kitchen waste, and other biodegradable materials. Wet waste tends to decompose quickly 
                        and should be properly separated for composting or disposal.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>By understanding the different types of waste and how to dispose of them correctly, we can reduce pollution, conserve resources, and contribute to 
                a healthier planet. The Smart Waste Sorting System helps simplify this process by using AI to automatically classify waste, ensuring more accurate 
                sorting and better environmental outcomes.</p>
